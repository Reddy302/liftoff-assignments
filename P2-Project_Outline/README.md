# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I really like playing Pokemon Go. It has kept me social through this pandemic and it is a lot of fun. There are two major aspects of the game; raiding and pvp. I do raids every day and haven't really made it very far into pvp yet. There is a lot to remember in order to be successful. Each Pokemon has a type (ie: fairy, dark, ghost, poison, grass, fire, etc...) and each type is weak to certain types and strong to certain types. Some pokemon can have multiple types, and on top of that; all pokemon can have moves that are of types that differ from their own type. I am not the kind of player that has been interested in Pokemon all of my life. I am a new player. There are players that have all of these things memorized for hundreds of Pokemon.

I want to create an app that will input my pvp team and each of my pokemon's moves; and while I am battling, I can tell the app which pokemon I am facing and it will tell me which pokemon or move to use against what I'm facing. I would like to eventually add in functionality for it to tell me what move types my opponent could be using and recommend the use of a shield against attacks or not.

### Features
Team Input: I will input the team I am using and each of their moves.
Opponent Selection: I will be able to select which pokemon I am fighting.
Recommendation: The app will display the possible moveset for the opponent selected and recommend which of my team to use according to defense and which attack to use according to the opponent's defense.

### Technologies
C#
JavaScript
HTML
CSS
VisualStudio
MySQL
ASP.NET

I expect that this list will continue to change as my project comes along.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I'm going to have to learn how to fill the database with all of the possible Pokemon and each possible move (possible API??). I also think that this is going to grow as my project grows. I am going to have to figure out how to get the app to make the correct recommendations. I might want to turn this into a Discord bot.
